GP 2: Graph Programming
=======================

GP 2 is a graph programming language originally developed by Chris Bak and Glyn Faulkner in 2015. Its original implementation can be found in the [UoYCS repository](https://github.com/UoYCS-plasma/GP2).

This project aims to add tracing functionality to the language by adding it as an option at compile-time. Compiling with tracing causes an XML tracefile to be saved along with the output graph at runtime. This tracefile is designed to be used with the [GP 2 IDE](https://github.com/jobbogamer/GP2-editor) to trace through the program's execution.

For building and usage instructions, see the [original README](https://github.com/UoYCS-plasma/GP2/blob/master/README.md).
